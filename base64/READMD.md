2. Privacy Preservation
3. Prevention of Unauthorized Access
4. Secure Communication
5. Protection Against Data Tampering
6. Compliance Requirements
7. Authentication

# Your challenge!
Chloe's Spoingus has just stolen the VERY SECRET and GUARDED index.html from our competitors, the macewan cybersecurity club. The only problem is that Spoingus speaks in a encrypted language, can you decipher what it means?


# Solution:
This is a challenge solved on March 8th during our weekly hacking hangout. First, the solvers have to open the developer mode and find the hidden code.
